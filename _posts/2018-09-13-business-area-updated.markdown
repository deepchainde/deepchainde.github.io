After several discussions with experts from technology, business, and public authorities, we decide to adjust our business areas to better match the current situation of the market and the company itself.

For the business area blockchain development the main industry we are going to focus will be 

  * Supply Chain - Trustworthy product tracing to fight against counterfeiting and pirating
  * Healthcare - Privacy-aware healthcare data sharing 
  * Energy - Peer-to-peer renewable energy trading

For the second business area **enterprise digitalization**, we will provide individual consulting and development service for small and medium enterprises to optimally digitalize their business processes with state-of-the-art IT technology.
